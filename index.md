I'm a Machine Learning and Deep Learning Practitioner. I’ve worked on many projects to date, some of which are out of my personal interests and the others as a part of my current and previous works as a <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/deathreaper0965" target="_blank">Machine Learning Engineer and Data Scientist</a>. I love working on Deep Learning tasks pertaining to Vision, Language and Speech as I always look out for how well I’m able to extract the features and how they are impacting the whole decision of the algorithm. I’m always keen to improve myself and keep updated with the latest advancements that are happening in our ever-evolving and rapidly developing world. 

<br />
Furthermore, I’m also a Meetup enthusiast, I enjoy attending and giving talks at local meetups on Machine Learning and Deep Learning. In my free time, I love solving puzzles, watching Ted-Ed videos and as a travel freak, I enjoy going hiking and exploring new places.
