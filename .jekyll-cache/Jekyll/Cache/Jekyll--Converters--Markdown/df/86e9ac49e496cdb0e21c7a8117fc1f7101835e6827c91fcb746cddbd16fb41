I"&<p>I’m a Machine Learning and Deep Learning Practitioner. I’ve worked on many projects to date, some of which are out of my personal interests and the remaining as a part of my current and previous works as a <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/deathreaper0965" target="_blank">Data Scientist</a>. I always enjoy dealing with large amounts of data when it comes to classical Machine Learning problems as we can dig out some precious hidden meanings from it. While in Deep Learning, Image data and Textual data always excites me and I always look out for how well I’m able to extract the features and how they are impacting the whole decision of the algorithm. I’m always keen to improve myself and keep updated with the latest advancements that are happening in our ever-evolving and rapidly developing world.</p>

Furthermore, I’m also a Meetup enthusiast, I enjoy attending and giving talks at local meetups on Machine Learning and Deep Learning. In my free time, I love solving puzzles, watching Ted-Ed videos and as a travel freak, I enjoy going hiking and exploring new places.</p>
